Description: scDETECT is an R package for single-cell RNA-seq DE analysis 
    accounting for the cell type correlations. scDETECT implements a Bayesian 
    hierarchical model to incorporate the cell type correlations into the modeling 
    of the gene expression, and then the DE genes are called based on the derived 
    posterior probabilities.
